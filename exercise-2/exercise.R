# Exercise 2: Data Frame Practice with `dplyr`.
# Use a different appraoch to accomplish the same tasks as exercise-1

# install and load dplyr
# install.packages("dplyr")
library("dplyr")

# Exercise 1: Data Frame Practice

# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
# install.packages('devtools')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the fueleconomy package
library(fueleconomy)

# You should now have access to the `vehicles` data.frame
View(vehicles)

# Select the different manufacturers (makes) of the cars in this data set.
makes <- select(vehicles, make)
View(makes)

# Use the `unique()` function to determine how many different car manufacturers
# are represented by the data set.
length(unique(makes$make))
nrow(distinct(vehicles, make))

# Filter the data set for vehicles manufactured in 1997
cars.1997 <- filter(vehicles, year == 1997)

# Arrange the 1997 cars by highway (`hwy`) gas milage
# Hint: use the `order()` function similar to how you would use the `max()` function.
# See also: https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-sorting-a-data-frame-by-the-contents-of-a-column/
cars.1997 <- arrange(cars.1997, hwy)

# Mutate the 1997 cars data frame to add a column `average` that has the average gas milage between
# city and highway for each car
cars.1997 <- mutate(cars.1997, average = (cty + hwy) / 2)
View(cars.1997)

# Filter the whole vehicles data set for 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city
# Save this new data frame in a variable.
two.wheel.more.than.20.city <- filter(vehicles, drive == '2-Wheel Drive', cty > 20)

# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?
# Hint: filter for the worst vecle, then select its ID.
filtered <- filter(two.wheel.more.than.20.city, hwy == min(hwy))
bad.hwy <- select(filtered, id)

# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters,
# and returns the vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year
# You'll need to filter more!

MostHwy <- function(my_make, my_year) {
  filtered <- filter(vehicles, my_make == make, my_year == year)
